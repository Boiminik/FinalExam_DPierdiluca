after the first commit I opened the branch feature/digitSum, where I added the feature as well as a unit test
I commited the changes, checkout to main, merged the two and pushed the result to the repository
after that I opened the branch feature/usage, where I added a counter for each use of the digitSum feature as well as a unit test
I proceeded as before, deleted both unused branches.

User Story 1:
As a user, I want to input a number and receive its digit sum, so that I can get the sum of all digits.
User Story 2:
As a user, I want to see how many times the digit sum feature has been used, so that I can track it.
